# Surfs_Up

## Overview 
In this analysis I gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. for June and Decemeber I query the database, transform that data into a list, then a dataframe and create summary statistics to describe the observations gathered from both lists. 

## Results 
June

 - Oahu has a temperate climate.  The figures from our statistics summary show moderation and lack huge temperature shifts into extremes. 
 - December is slightly cooler than June.
 - December has a greater standard deviation meaning there is greater variablility to the weather in the winter months. 

 ## Summary 
 
 Overall, the weather in Oahu is temperate. The weather stays fairly consistent throughtout the year. Max temps for June and December were (85, 83) respectively and Min temps were (56, 64). Mean temps for June and December were very similar, only varying by about 4 degrees, 75 and 71 respectively. This is great news for the Ice Cream and Surf Shop owners of Oahu. Oahu has ideal temperatures year round. 
 
### Additional Research and Analysis 

Temperature reports from Oahu came back overwhelmingly positive. However, I woud repeat this analysis for precipitation. While the island may have ideal temperatures islands in Hawaii are known to have pretty severe storms depending on terrain and location.  First, I would look at summary statistics of Oahu's precipitation in June and then in deceember to see if there is a wet and dry season on the island. Then, I would change the locations of the stations to see how different parts of the island are effected.
